      <h3>Reflection on learning Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        Learning Web Development has been very interesting for me even tho i do not think of going further with Web Development in future, in class when we 
        looked at latest UI design websites they really fasinated me with how user friendly and responsive they were. In my opinion Web Development is a very skillful
        and rewarding path to follow. Learning to optimise resourses used in the website and how that affects the websites performance, using flexbox, creating websites which are mobile friendly and
learning HTML and css has been really pleasing and i can say that i have learned alot. I have enjoyed the whole teaching process which is every lesson we learn a new thing which will help us to complete our assessment.
Also, the support from the course teacher has been really good, even when not in university we can use this app called SLACK to ask any questions when you are stuck.</p>
