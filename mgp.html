    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.uplabs.com/posts/bikes-shop">Model1</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.abelodor.com/">Model2</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.mirrorconf.com/">Model3</a></li>
      </ul>
    <p> These 3 are the models that me and my colleuges looked at as a group to gather ideas for our UI design. I really liked the way that all three of the 
      website were really responsive and smooth. I also liked the way how sound was used in Model2, the sound gives a feeling of being in a busy shopping which matches the model being a E-commerce Website.
After looking and playing around with these three models we decided to come up with a similar type of UI design. Since we are not so skilled in the latest UI design features we did our 
best to include some features available in those models. We kept on referencing on the models while we were working on our website to improve and try add those unique features into our own websites. Similarly, all these models
were mobile friendly too as most of the web browsing is done through mobile phones these days. Some of the key factors to take into consideration when designing an interface are keeping the interface simple, using common UI elements, 
purposeful page layout andcarefully using colors and textures.
