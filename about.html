<div class="about">

<p style="font: size 20px;">My name is Sirish Khatry, i was born in Kathmandu, Nepal. Since childhood i was always into sports
   and i used to play a variaty of them such as Football, Table Tennis, Badminton and Cricket. Currently I am a Software Development studnet in 
   Northampon University who also works at Las Iguanas restaurant on a part-time basis. My current hobbies are to watch movies, go out with my friends, play football and listen to music.
   I am a very friendly, out going and active person. Every sunday i play a football match with my sunday league team which has helped me to stay fit and healthy. In future i aspire to be a 
   software developer here is a small information on software developer job.Software developers do not require very high skill on HTML compared to Games Developer or Web Developers. The salary also seems to be more than what a Web or Games developer earns which is £45,000-£55,000 per annum  
   This particular job that i have researched on is at Halifax, West Yorkshire. The main skill required for this job is on C# or VB.Net. However, good knowledge of Web services, Automated Unit Testing and Continuous Integration is also required which was not required in any of the jobs that we looked at earlier.
